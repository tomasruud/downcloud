      <p>
        Due to recent changes in Soundcloud APIs, this app is left in a
        rather broken state. This leaves me with two possible paths
        regarding the future for this application:
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-3">
        <li class="mt-3 ml-4">
          Cease any further development and let people use the
          <em>download track</em> functionality that is already built into
          the current version of Soundcloud.
        </li>
        <li class="mt-3 ml-4">
          Migrate this application out of the browser, to a command line
          client for instance, and continue development.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p class="mt-3">
        Personally I'm not using this tool myself anymore, but for anyone
        interested in continuing to use a tool like this, I suggest dropping
        a comment or reaction over at
        <a

        the ticket I've set up on Github
        </a>. If there is enough interest, I would like to continue doing some
        work on this, but it depends on the demand.
      </p>
