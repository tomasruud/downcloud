This leaves me with two possible paths regarding the future for this application: </p> <ol class="list-decimal list-inside mt-3"> <li class="ml-4 mt-3"> Cease any further development and let people use the <em>download track</em> functionality that is already built into the current version of Soundcloud. </li> <li class="ml-4 mt-3"> Migrate this application out of the browser, to a command line client for instance, and continue development. </li> </ol> <p class="mt-3"> Personally I'm not using this tool myself anymore, but for anyone interested in continuing to use a tool like this, I suggest dropping a comment or reaction over at <a href="https://github.com/tomasruud/downcloud/issues/12" target="_blank" class="cursor-pointer font-bold hover:underline no-underline text-purple-500" rel="noopener noreferrer"> the ticket I've set up on Github </a>. If there is enough interest, I would like to continue doing some work on this, but it depends on the demand. </p> <p class="mt-3"> <em> Cheers, <br> Tomas </em> </p> </main> </div> </body></html>
